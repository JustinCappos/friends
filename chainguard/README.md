# Chainguard

Chainguard builds secure container images that eliminate CVEs from the start.

Their core product is Chainguard Images, which are a collection of container
images that have been designed to be secure and minimal. These images are built
from source with a minimal set of dependencies, which helps to reduce the attack
surface and make them less vulnerable to security vulnerabilities. All
Chainguard Images come with a software bill of materials (SBOM) and SLSA
attestations, which make use of the in-toto attestation format.
