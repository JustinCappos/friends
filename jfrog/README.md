JFrog Artifactory leverages a secure evidence‑management mechanism: using the JFrog CLI, users can attach cryptographically signed evidence files—containing metadata like test results, scans, or approvals—to artifacts, packages, builds, or Release Bundles. These evidence files are stored directly alongside the subject in Artifactory, automatically named, and structured into Evidence Predicate, Evidence Payload, and Evidence Envelope layers to support tamper‑evident provenance and auditability.
